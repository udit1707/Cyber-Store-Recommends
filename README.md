# CyberStore Recommends

## Description

***Why Collaborative Filtering?***
- The collaborative filtering method predicts the interests of a user on a product by collecting preferences information from many other users (collaborating). The assumption behind the collaborative filtering method is that if a person P1 has the same opinion as another person P2 on an issue, P1 is more likely to share P2â€™s opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.

## Model-Based Filter
***In this project we use the Singular Value Decomposition Machine Learning Algo to predict a user's rating for unrated shopping products***
